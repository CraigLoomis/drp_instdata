The oimage filenames are fully descriptive of the image stack. They look like

pfsREDdesc3-13.dat_foc-250_frd31_sfld00.imgstk

The first token (before the first underscore) is the optics design
file name, shorn of its .dat extension. 

The _foc-250 describes the location of the detector in microns (-250)
relative to its nominal position.  Negative number are OUTSIDE of focus. 

If we defocus moving the slit instead of the detector, there is an
additional token _slfXXXXX, where XXXXX is the signed slit position
relative to nominal in microns. 

The next token is _frd, which gives the FRD gaussian sigma in units of
10^{-4} radians, so frd31 is sigFRD = .0031.  

_sfld is the field angle of the Subaru telescope in minutes of arc (0-41)

These .imgstk files are self-documenting, but are not FITS tables. There are 5 
data structures in the files.

The first, at the beginning of the file, is an ASCII header. An example
is given here:

The first four lines give information about the input optical design; its
name, the date of this execution, the radius of the slit, and the slit-pupil
distance.

NLAM is the dimension of the wavelength array 

LAM[] is the list of wavelengths traced

Next is focus information of various sorts. The focus can be changed either
by moving the detector or by moving the slit. 

SLITOFFSET is the axial position of the slit relative to its nominal location;
the focus moves by approximately 1/4.7 of this number

FOFFSET is the axial displacement of the detector from its nominal position.

FSLOPE is the slope in the dispersion direction of the focal surface. We do
not change this parameter in these traces; it is determined by least-squares
fitting a plane to the focal surface in the nominally in-focus system.

FRD_ON is a flag for FRD. 0 is `no FRD', which is actually infinite FRD;
the full pupil is illuminated uniformly. 1 is a specified sigFRD, but there
is no Subaru field dependence. 2 is a specified sigFRD AND a specified
Subaru field angle.

FRD_SIGMA is the supplied sigFRD, assumed a circular gaussian with this sigma.

SUBARU_FLD_ANGLE is the Subaru field angle in arcminutes (actually the
input direction cosine in arcmin). 41' is the extreme angle in the Cobra
array.

SUBARU_SB_NABIN is the number of NAs on which the fiber NA array for
description of surface brightness in the fibers is defined. This is the
dimension of an array to be found later in the file.

DET_DIFFUSION_SIGMA is the assumed (gaussian) diffusion sigma in the
detector, in mm.

NANG is the dimension of the input direction cosine array, 

SINANG[] is the list of input direction cosines. The slit heights can be 
found by multiplying these numbers by the SLIT-VPUPIL_DISTANCE.

XSIZE, YSIZE are the number of rows and columns, respectively, in the images

NIMAGE is (NLAM*NANG), the number of images

XPIX, YPIX are the pitches of the images in the x and y direcrions, in mm/pixel.

IMPEAK is the peak image value in all the images in the array. The images are
floats, but are made by scaling the frd and surface-brightness weighted 
number of rays falling in each pixel by 100 and truncating, so have
integer values; this is done to make the images compress better.

Then come some comments about the offsets to the other four structures.
(the offsets are integral kilobytes (1024).

HDROFFS = 0 is the offset to the header, 2K bytes allocated.
DESOFFS is the offset to the vtra design file for the spectrograph;
    10K-2K=8K  bytes allocated; typical use is half that.
SBOFFS is the offset to the surface brightness array. This is an array
    of SUBARU_SB_NABIN  (NA,SB) float doubles. Normally 79 entries (Don't ask).
    12K-10K = 2K bytes allocated; about 640 used
XYFOFFS is the offset to the location/focus array. This is an array of
    NIMAGE triples: (x in mm, y in mm, foc in mm) for each image. foc
    is the distance from the nominal FLAT, perpendicular to the axis 
    focal plane of the system.
DATOFFS is the offset to the images, each a XSIZE x YSIZE matrix of
    floats. The offset of the pixel in column j of row i of image n
    is DATOFFS + (n*XSIZE*YSIZE + i*XSIZE + j)*sizeof(float)

The uncompressed images are 63,483,904 bytes in size; near focus with
1.5 micron pixels they gzip compress by a factor of about 20, but far from
focus the images fill a substantial fraction of the frame and the compression
is much worse.
